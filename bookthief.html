									<p>The Book Thief is a historical novel by Australian author <strong>Markus Zusak</strong>, and is his most popular work. Published in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into 63 languages and sold 16 million copies. It was adapted into a 2013 feature film of the same name.</p>

									<p>
										The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel, a little girl who is taken to a new home because her mother can't afford to take care of her. The story is told by Death, who becomes a character you come to respect and even feel sorry for by the end. The narration puts an odd perspective on the story. Much of what Death says is very philosophical, and even beautiful.

<p>The Book Thief is set in Nazi Germany, at the start of World War Two. On the journey to her new home, Liesel's younger brother dies and she steals her first book: The Gravedigger's Handbook. When she arrives at her new home, she suddenly has a new mama and papa. Haunted every night by nightmares of her brother's death, Liesel and her Papa set themselves the challenge of reading the book, Liesel's last link to her brother.
</p>
<p>
	I found this book a bit of an eye opener. It is one of the first books about the war that I have read that is from somebody living in Germany's point of view. It makes you realise that so many people in Germany became victims of the war, that they weren't all evil as they are often portrayed. It is not the kind of story that has you crying one moment and laughing the next. The sadness surrounding Liesel's story creeps up on you, until suddenly you realise that it was like this for so many, and how serious it was, and is.
</p>
<p>
In reflection, The Book Thief leaves behind a sense of guilt, in some ways. Because it is the British bombs that are falling in Germany, the British who kill so many in the story and leave the reader's cheeks soaked in tears.
</p>
<p>
Overall I would rate it 8/10, and recommend it to anyone aged 13 and upwards, as it is a serious story, and may not be fully understood by those younger.

									<h2>Plot</h2>
									
									<p>Narrated by Death, a male voice who over the course of the book proves to be morose yet caring, the plot follows Liesel Meminger as she comes of age in Nazi Germany during World War II. After the death of her younger brother on a train to the fictional town of Molching, Germany, on the outskirts of Munich, Liesel arrives at the home of her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, distraught and withdrawn. During her time there, she is exposed to the horrors of the Nazi regime, caught between the innocence of childhood and the maturity demanded by her destructive surroundings. As the political situation in Germany deteriorates, her foster parents conceal a Jewish fist-fighter named Max Vandenburg. Hans, who has developed a close relationship with Liesel, teaches her to read, first in her bedroom, then in the basement. Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the Nazi party is looking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. Through collecting laundry for her foster mother, she also begins a relationship with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her to first read books in her library, and later, steal them.
</p>
<p>

	One day, as a group of Jewish prisoners is led through town towards Dachau Concentration Camp, Hans offers one particularly weak man a piece of bread, drawing the ire of others in the town. Max leaves the Hubermanns' home soon after out of fear that Hans's act will draw suspicion on the Hubermann household and their activities. Eventually, as punishment for this act, Hans's long-withheld application to join the NSDAP is approved and he is drafted into the army, cleaning up the aftermath of air raids on the German home front. A while later, Liesel sees Max among a group of prisoners and joins him in the march, ignoring a soldier's order to step away and getting whipped as punishment.
</p>
<p>

	After Hans returns home, bombs fall on Liesel's street in Molching, killing every one of her friends, family, and neighbors. Liesel, working on her manuscript in the basement at the time of the raid, is the sole survivor. The workers, searching for survivors and cleaning up the scene, take Liesel's manuscript along with the rubble, but Death saves it. Devastated, Liesel is taken in by the Hermanns and refuses to clean the ashes off herself until she walks into the river where Rudy saved a book before, saying her final goodbyes to him. In 1945, Liesel works in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father when Max enters. They have an emotional reunion.
</p>
<p>

	Many years later, "just yesterday", Liesel dies as an old woman in the suburbs of Sydney, with a family and many friends, but has never forgotten Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and her brother. When Death collects her soul, he gives her the manuscript she lost in the bombing. She asks him if he read it and Death says yes. She asks him if he understood it, but Death is confused and unable to understand the duality of humanity. Death's last words are for both Liesel and the reader: "I am haunted by humans."
